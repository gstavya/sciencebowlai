Kinematics deals with the description of how objects
move. The description of the motion of any object must
always be given relative to some particular reference frame.
The displacement of an object is the change in position of
the object.

Average speed is the distance traveled divided by the elapsed
time or time interval, (the time period over which we choose
to make our observations). An object’s average velocity over
a particular time interval is

v = x/t

where x is the displacement during the time interval t
The instantaneous velocity, whose magnitude is the same
as the instantaneous speed, is defined as the average velocity
taken over an infinitesimally short time interval.

Acceleration is the change of velocity per unit time. An
object’s average acceleration over a time interval t is

a = v/t

where v is the change of velocity during the time interval t
Instantaneous acceleration is the average acceleration taken
over an infinitesimally short time interval.

If an object has position and velocity at time and
moves in a straight line with constant acceleration, the velocity v
and position x at a later time are related to the acceleration a,
the initial position x0 and the initial velocity v0 by:

v = v0 + at,
x = x0 + v0 t + 1/2 at^2
v^2 = v0^2 + 2a(x-x0)
v_average = (v+v0)/2

Objects that move vertically near the surface of the Earth,
either falling or having been projected vertically up or down,
move with the constant downward acceleration due to gravity,
whose magnitude is g = 9.80 m/s^2 if air resistance can be
ignored. We can apply Eqs. 2–11 for constant acceleration to
objects that move up or down freely near the Earth’s surface.
The slope of a curve at any point on a graph is the slope
of the tangent to the curve at that point. On a graph of position vs. time, the slope is equal to the instantaneous velocity.
On a graph of velocity vs. time, the slope is the acceleration.

'''

A quantity such as velocity, that has both a magnitude and a
direction, is called a vector. A quantity such as mass, that has
only a magnitude, is called a scalar. On diagrams, vectors are
represented by arrows.
Addition of vectors can be done graphically by placing the
tail of each successive arrow at the tip of the previous one. The
sum, or resultant vector, is the arrow drawn from the tail of the
first vector to the tip of the last vector. Two vectors can also be
added using the parallelogram method.
Vectors can be added more accurately by adding their
components along chosen axes with the aid of trigonometric
functions. A vector of magnitude V making an angle with the
axis has components

Vx = V cos u, Vy = V sin u.

Given the components, we can find a vector’s magnitude and
direction from

V = sqrt(Vx^2+Vy^2), tan(theta) = Vy/Vx

Projectile motion is the motion of an object in the air near the
Earth’s surface under the effect of gravity alone. It can be analyzed
as two separate motions if air resistance can be ignored. The horizontal component of motion is at constant velocity, whereas the
vertical component is at constant acceleration, just as for an
object falling vertically under the action of gravity.
The velocity of an object relative to one frame of reference can be found by vector addition if its velocity relative to a
second frame of reference, and the relative velocity of the two
reference frames, are known.

Newton’s three laws of motion are the basic classical laws
describing motion.
Newton’s first law (the law of inertia) states that if the net
force on an object is zero, an object originally at rest remains
at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion in a straight
line with constant velocity.
Newton’s second law states that the acceleration of an
object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it, and
inversely proportional to its mass:
(4;1)
Newton’s second law is one of the most important and fundamental laws in classical physics.
Newton’s third law states that whenever one object exerts
a force on a second object, the second object always exerts a
force on the first object which is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction:
(4;2)
where is the force on object B exerted by object A.
The tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion
is called inertia. Mass is a measure of the inertia of an object.

Weight refers to the gravitational force on an object, and is
equal to the product of the object’s mass m and the acceleration
of gravity
(4;3)
Force, which is a vector, can be considered as a push or pull;
or, from Newton’s second law, force can be defined as an action
capable of giving rise to acceleration. The net force on an object
is the vector sum of all forces acting on that object.
When two objects slide over one another, the force of
friction that each object exerts on the other can be written
approximately as where is the normal force
(the force each object exerts on the other perpendicular to their
contact surfaces), and is the coefficient of kinetic friction. If
the objects are at rest relative to each other, then is just
large enough to hold them at rest and satisfies the inequality
where is the coefficient of static friction.
For solving problems involving the forces on one or more
objects, it is essential to draw a free-body diagram for each
object, showing all the forces acting on only that object.
Newton’s second law can be applied to the vector components
for each object.

An object moving in a circle of radius r with constant speed v is
said to be in uniform circular motion. It has a radial acceleration
that is directed radially toward the center of the circle (also
called centripetal acceleration), and has magnitude
(5;1)
The velocity vector and the acceleration vector are continually changing in direction, but are perpendicular to each other
at each moment.
A force is needed to keep an object revolving in a circle,
and the direction of this force is toward the center of the circle.
This force could be due to gravity (as for the Moon), to tension
in a cord, to a component of the normal force, or to another
type of force or combination of forces.
[*When the speed of circular motion is not constant, the
acceleration has two components, tangential as well as
centripetal.]
Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that every
particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force

aR
proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:

The direction of this force is along the line joining the two
particles, and the force is always attractive. It is this gravitational
force that keeps the Moon revolving around the Earth, and the
planets revolving around the Sun.
Satellites revolving around the Earth are acted on by
gravity, but “stay up” because of their high tangential speed.
Newton’s three laws of motion, plus his law of universal
gravitation, constituted a wide-ranging theory of the universe.
With them, motion of objects on Earth and in space could be
accurately described. And they provided a theoretical base for
Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.
The four fundamental forces in nature are (1) the gravitational force, (2) the electromagnetic force, (3) the strong nuclear
force, and (4) the weak nuclear force. The first two fundamental
forces are responsible for nearly all “everyday” forces.

Work is done on an object by a force when the object moves
through a distance d. If the direction of a constant force
makes an angle with the direction of motion, the work done
by this force is
(6;1)
Energy can be defined as the ability to do work. In SI units,
work and energy are measured in joules
Kinetic energy (KE) is energy of motion. An object of
mass m and speed v has translational kinetic energy
(6;3)
The work-energy principle states that the net work done on
an object (by the net force) equals the change in kinetic energy
of that object:
(6;4)
Potential energy (PE) is energy associated with forces that
depend on the position or configuration of objects. Gravitational
potential energy is

reference point. Elastic potential energy is given by

from the unstretched position and k is the spring stiffness constant. Other potential energies include chemical, electrical, and
nuclear energy. The change in potential energy when an object
changes position is equal to the external work needed to take
the object from one position to the other.
Potential energy is associated only with conservative forces,
for which the work done by the force in moving an object from
one position to another depends only on the two positions and
not on the path taken. Nonconservative forces like friction are
different—work done by them does depend on the path taken
and potential energy cannot be defined for them.
The law of conservation of energy states that energy can
be transformed from one type to another, but the total energy
remains constant. It is valid even when friction is present,
because the heat generated can be considered a form of energy
transfer. When only conservative forces act, the total mechanical
energy is conserved:

When nonconservative forces such as friction act, then

Power is defined as the rate at which work is done, or the
rate at which energy is transformed. The SI unit of power is
the watt (1 W = 1 Js).

The linear momentum, of an object is defined as the product
of its mass times its velocity,
(7;1)
In terms of momentum, Newton’s second law can be written
as
(7;2)
That is, the rate of change of momentum of an object equals
the net force exerted on it.
When the net external force on a system of objects is
zero, the total momentum remains constant. This is the law of
conservation of momentum. Stated another way, the total
momentum of an isolated system of objects remains constant.
The law of conservation of momentum is very useful in
dealing with collisions. In a collision, two (or more) objects
interact with each other over a very short time interval, and the
force each exerts on the other during this time interval is very
large compared to any other forces acting.
The impulse delivered by a force on an object is defined as
(7;5)
where is the average force acting during the (usually very
short) time interval The impulse is equal to the change in
momentum of the object:

Summary
An interesting application is the discovery of nearby stars (see Section 5–8)
that seem to “wobble.” It could be that a planet
orbits the star, and each exerts a gravitational force on the other. The planets are
too small and too far away to be observed directly by telescopes. But the slight
wobble in the motion of the star suggests that both the planet and the star (its sun)
orbit about their mutual center of mass, and hence the star appears to have a wobble.
Irregularities in the star’s motion can be measured to high accuracy, yielding
information on the size of the planets’ orbits and their masses. See Fig. 5–30 in
Chapter 5.
and are their momenta after, then momentum conservation tells us that

for this two-object system.
Total energy is also conserved. But this may not be helpful
unless kinetic energy is conserved, in which case the collision is
called an elastic collision and we can write
(7;6)
If kinetic energy is not conserved, the collision is called
inelastic. Macroscopic collisions are generally inelastic.
A completely inelastic collision is one in which the colliding
objects stick together after the collision.
The center of mass (CM) of an extended object (or group of
objects) is that point at which the net force can be considered
to act, for purposes of determining the translational motion of
the object as a whole. The x component of the CM for objects
with mass is given by
(7;9a)
[*The center of mass of a system of total mass M moves in
the same path that a particle of mass M would move if subjected
to the same net external force. In equation form, this is Newton’s
second law for a system of particles (or extended objects):
(7;11)
where M is the total mass of the system, is the acceleration
of the CM of the system, and is the total (net) external
force acting on all parts of the system.

When a rigid object rotates about a fixed axis, each point of the
object moves in a circular path. Lines drawn perpendicularly
from the rotation axis to various points in the object all sweep
out the same angle in any given time interval.
Angles are conventionally measured in radians, where one
radian is the angle subtended by an arc whose length is equal
to the radius, or
Angular velocity, is defined as the rate of change of

An object at rest is said to be in equilibrium. The subject concerned with the determination of the forces within a structure
at rest is called statics.
The two necessary conditions for an object to be in equilibrium are (1) the vector sum of all the forces on it must
be zero, and (2) the sum of all the torques (calculated about
any arbitrary axis) must also be zero. For a two-dimensional
problem we can write
(9;1, 9;2)
It is important when doing statics problems to apply the
equilibrium conditions to only one object at a time.
An object in static equilibrium is said to be in (a) stable,
(b) unstable, or (c) neutral equilibrium, depending on whether a
slight displacement leads to (a) a return to the original position,
(b) further movement away from the original position, or
(c) rest in the new position. An object in stable equilibrium is
also said to be in balance.
Hooke’s law applies to many elastic solids, and states
that the change in length of an object is proportional to the
©Fx = 0, ©Fy = 0, ©t = 0.
applied force:
(9;3)
If the force is too great, the object will exceed its elastic limit,
which means it will no longer return to its original shape when
the distorting force is removed. If the force is even greater, the
ultimate strength of the material can be exceeded, and the
object will fracture. The force per unit area acting on an object
is the stress, and the resulting fractional change in length is the
strain.
The stress on an object is present within the object and
can be of three types: compression, tension, or shear. The ratio
of stress to strain is called the elastic modulus of the material.
Young’s modulus applies for compression and tension, and the
shear modulus for shear. Bulk modulus applies to an object
whose volume changes as a result of pressure on all sides. All
three moduli are constants for a given material when distorted
within the elastic region.
[*Arches and domes are special ways to span a space that
allow the stresses to be managed well.]

The three common phases of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.
Liquids and gases are collectively called fluids, meaning they
have the ability to flow. The density of a material is defined as
its mass per unit volume:
(10;1)
Specific gravity (SG) is the ratio of the density of the material to
the density of water (at 4°C).
Pressure is defined as force per unit area:
(10;2)
The pressure P at a depth h in a liquid of constant density , due
to the weight of the liquid, is given by
(10;3a)
where g is the acceleration due to gravity.
Pascal’s principle says that an external pressure applied to
a confined fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid.
Pressure is measured using a manometer or other type of
gauge. A barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure.
Standard atmospheric pressure (average at sea level) is
Gauge pressure is the total (absolute) pressure minus atmospheric pressure.
Archimedes’ principle states that an object submerged
wholly or partially in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to
the weight of fluid it displaces (FB = mF g = rFVdispl g).

Fluid flow can be characterized either as streamline
(also called laminar), in which the layers of fluid move
smoothly and regularly along paths called streamlines, or as
turbulent, in which case the flow is not smooth and regular but
is characterized by irregularly shaped whirlpools.
Fluid flow rate is the mass or volume of fluid that passes a
given point per unit time. The equation of continuity states
that for an incompressible fluid flowing in an enclosed tube,
the product of the velocity of flow and the cross-sectional area
of the tube remains constant:
(10;4)
Bernoulli’s principle tells us that where the velocity of a
fluid is high, the pressure in it is low, and where the velocity is
low, the pressure is high. For steady laminar flow of an incompressible and nonviscous fluid, Bernoulli’s equation, which is
based on the law of conservation of energy, is
(10;5)
for two points along the flow.
[*Viscosity refers to friction within a fluid and is essentially
a frictional force between adjacent layers of fluid as they move
past one another.]
[*Liquid surfaces hold together as if under tension
(surface tension), allowing drops to form and objects like needles
and insects to stay on the surface.

CONCEPT 1.1
Studying the diverse forms of life reveals common
themes (pp. 2–7)
Theme: Organization
t The hierarchy of life unfolds as follows: biosphere > ecosystem >
community > population > organism > organ system > organ
> tissue > cell > organelle > molecule > atom. With each step
up, new properties emerge (emergent properties) as a result of
interactions among components at the lower levels.
t Structure and function are correlated at all levels of biological
organization. The cell is the lowest level of organization that can
perform all activities required for life. Cells are either prokaryotic
or eukaryotic. Eukaryotic cells have a DNA-containing nucleus
and other membrane-enclosed organelles. Prokaryotic cells lack
such organelles.
Theme: Information
t Genetic information is encoded in the nucleotide sequences
of DNA. It is DNA that transmits heritable information from
parents to offspring. DNA sequences (called genes) program a
cell’s protein production by being transcribed into RNA and then
translated into specific proteins, a process called gene expression. Gene expression also produces RNAs that are not translated into protein but serve other important functions.
Theme: Energy and Matter
t Energy flows through an ecosystem. All organisms must perform work, which requires energy. Producers convert energy
from sunlight to chemical energy, some of which is then passed
on to consumers (the rest is lost from the ecosystem as heat).
Chemicals cycle between organisms and the environment.
Theme: Interactions
Plants take up nutrients from the soil and chemicals from the air and
use energy from the sun. Interactions among plants, animals,
and other organisms affect the participants in varying ways.
CONCEPT 1.2
The Core Theme: Evolution accounts for the unity
and diversity of life (pp. 7–11)
t Biologists classify species according to a system of broader and
broader groups. Domain Bacteria and domain Archaea consist of prokaryotes. Domain Eukarya, the eukaryotes, includes
various groups of protists as well as plants, fungi, and animals.
As diverse as life is, there is also evidence of remarkable unity,
which is revealed in the similarities between different kinds of
organisms.
t Darwin proposed natural selection as the mechanism for evolutionary adaptation of populations to their environments. Each
species is one twig of a branching tree of life extending back in
time through ancestral species more and more remote. All of life
is connected through its long evolutionary history.

Biological inquiry entails forming and testing
hypotheses based on observations of nature
(pp. 11–16)
t In scientific inquiry, scientists make observations (collect data)
and use inductive reasoning to draw a general conclusion,
which can be developed into a testable hypothesis. Deductive
reasoning makes predictions that can be used to test hypotheses.
Scientific hypotheses must be falsifiable.
t Controlled experiments, such as the study investigating coat
color in mouse populations, are designed to demonstrate the effect of one variable by testing control groups and experimental
groups that differ in only that one variable.
t A scientific theory is broad in scope, generates new hypotheses,
and is supported by a large body of evidence.
t Scientists must be able to repeat each other’s results, so integrity
is key. Biologists approach questions at different levels; their approaches complement each other. Technology is a method or
device that applies scientific knowledge for some specific purpose that affects society as well as for scientific research. Diversity among scientists promotes progress in science.

CONCEPT 2.1
Matter consists of chemical elements in pure form and
in combinations called compounds (pp. 19–20)
• Elements cannot be broken down chemically to other substances. A compound contains two or more different elements
in a fixed ratio. Oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen make up
approximately 96% of living matter.
CONCEPT 2.2
An element’s properties depend on the structure
of its atoms (pp. 20–24)
• An atom, the smallest unit of an element, has the following
components:
• An electrically neutral atom has equal numbers of electrons and
protons; the number of protons determines the atomic number.
Isotopes of an element differ from each other in neutron number
and therefore mass. Unstable isotopes give off particles and energy as radioactivity.
• In an atom, electrons occupy specific electron shells; the electrons
in a shell have a characteristic energy level. Electron distribution in
shells determines the chemical behavior of an atom. An atom that
has an incomplete outer shell, the valence shell, is reactive.
DRAW IT Draw the electron distribution diagrams for neon
(10Ne) and argon (18Ar).
CONCEPT 2.3
The formation and function of molecules depend on
chemical bonding between atoms (pp. 24–28)
• Chemical bonds form when atoms interact and complete their
valence shells. Covalent bonds form when pairs of electrons
are shared. H2 has a single bond: H i H. A double bond is the
sharing of two pairs of electrons, as in O w O.
• Molecules consist of two or more covalently bonded atoms. The
attraction of an atom for the electrons of a covalent bond is its
electronegativity. Electrons of a polar covalent bond are pulled
closer to the more electronegative atom.
• An ion forms when an atom or molecule gains or loses an electron and becomes charged. An ionic bond is the attraction between two oppositely charged ions, such as Na+ and Cl−.
• Weak bonds reinforce the shapes of large molecules and help molecules adhere to each other. A hydrogen bond is an attraction between a hydrogen atom carrying a partial positive charge (δ+) and
an electronegative atom (δ−). Van der Waals interactions occur
between transiently positive and negative regions of molecules.

• Molecular shape is usually the basis for the recognition of one
biological molecule by another.
CONCEPT 2.4
Chemical reactions make and break chemical bonds
(pp. 28–29)
• Chemical reactions change reactants into products while conserving matter. All chemical reactions are theoretically reversible.
Chemical equilibrium is reached when the forward and reverse
reaction rates are equal.
What would happen to the concentration of products if more
reactants were added to a reaction that was in chemical equilibrium How would this addition affect the equilibrium
CONCEPT 2.5
Hydrogen bonding gives water properties that help
make life possible on Earth (pp. 29–37)
• A hydrogen bond forms when the
slightly negatively charged oxygen of one
water molecule is attracted to the slightly
positively charged hydrogen of a nearby
water molecule. Hydrogen bonding
between water molecules is the
basis for water’s properties.
• Hydrogen bonding keeps
water molecules close to each
other, giving water cohesion.
Hydrogen bonding is also
responsible for water’s surface
tension.
• Water has a high specific heat: Heat is absorbed when hydrogen
bonds break and is released when hydrogen bonds form. This
helps keep temperatures relatively steady, within limits that permit life. Evaporative cooling is based on water’s high heat of
vaporization. The evaporative loss of the most energetic water
molecules cools a surface.
• Ice floats because it is less
dense than liquid water.
This property allows life to
exist under the frozen surfaces
of lakes and seas.
• Water is an unusually versatile solvent because its polar
molecules are attracted to ions
and polar substances that can form hydrogen bonds. Hydrophilic
substances have an affinity for water; hydrophobic substances do
not. Molarity, the number of moles of solute per liter of solution,
is used as a measure of solute concentration in solutions. A mole
is a certain number of molecules of a substance. The mass of a
mole of a substance in grams is the same as the molecular mass
in daltons.
• A water molecule can transfer an H+ to another water molecule
to form H3O+ (represented simply by H+) and OH−.

The concentration of H+ is
expressed as pH; pH = –log
[H+]. A buffer consists of an
acid-base pair that combines
reversibly with hydrogen
ions, allowing it to resist pH
changes.
• The burning of fossil fuels
increases the amount of CO2
in the atmosphere. Some CO2
dissolves in the oceans, causing ocean acidification, which
has potentially grave consequences for coral reefs.

Carbon atoms can form diverse molecules by bonding
to four other atoms (pp. 41–44)
t Carbon, with a valence of 4, can bond to various other atoms,
including O, H, and N. Carbon can also bond to other carbon
atoms, forming the carbon skeletons of organic compounds.
These skeletons vary in length and shape.
t Chemical groups attached to the carbon skeletons of organic
molecules participate in chemical reactions (functional
groups) or contribute to function by affecting molecular shape.
t ATP (adenosine triphosphate) can react with water, releasing
energy that can be used by the cell.

Macromolecules are polymers, built from monomers
(pp. 44–45)
t Proteins, nucleic acids, and large carbohydrates (polysaccharides)
are polymers, which are chains of monomers. Monomers form
larger molecules by dehydration reactions, in which water molecules are released. Polymers can disassemble by the reverse process, hydrolysis. In cells, dehydration reactions and hydrolysis
are catalyzed by enzymes. An immense variety of polymers can
be built from a small set of monomers.

Biologists use microscopes and the tools of
biochemistry to study cells (pp. 67–69)
• Improvements in microscopy that affect the parameters of magnification, resolution, and contrast have catalyzed progress in the
study of cell structure. The light microscope (LM) and electron
microscope (EM), as well as other types, remain important tools.
• Cell biologists can obtain pellets enriched in particular cellular components by centrifuging disrupted cells at sequential speeds, a process known as cell fractionation. Larger cellular components are in
the pellet after lower-speed centrifugation, and smaller components

Eukaryotic cells have internal membranes that
compartmentalize their functions (pp. 69–74)
• All cells are bounded by a plasma membrane.
• Prokaryotic cells lack nuclei and other membrane-enclosed

concentration gradient. Ion channels facilitate the diffusion of
ions across a membrane. Carrier proteins can undergo changes
in shape that transport bound solutes.
Describe the free water concentration inside and out.
CONCEPT 5.4
Active transport uses energy to move solutes against
their gradients (pp. 103–106)
t Specific membrane proteins use energy,
usually in the form of ATP, to do the work
of active transport.
t Ions can have both a concentration (chemical) gradient and an electrical gradient
(voltage). These combine in the electrochemical gradient, which determines the
net direction of ionic diffusion.
t Cotransport of two solutes occurs when
a membrane protein enables the “downhill” diffusion of one solute to drive the
“uphill” transport of the other.
CONCEPT 5.5
Bulk transport across the plasma membrane occurs
by exocytosis and endocytosis (pp. 106–107)
t Three main types of endocytosis are phagocytosis,
pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis.
CONCEPT 5.6
The plasma membrane plays a key role in most cell
signaling (pp. 108–113)
t In local signaling, animal cells may communicate by direct contact
or by secreting local regulators. For long-distance signaling, both
animals and plants use hormones; animals also signal electrically.
t Signaling molecules that bind to membrane receptors trigger a
three-stage cell-signaling pathway:

SUMMARY OF KEY CONCEPTS
CONCEPT 5.1
Cellular membranes are fluid mosaics of lipids
and proteins (pp. 94–98)
t In the fluid mosaic model, amphipathic proteins are embedded
in the phospholipid bilayer.
t Phospholipids and some proteins move laterally within the
membrane. The unsaturated hydrocarbon tails of some phospholipids keep membranes fluid at lower temperatures, while
cholesterol helps membranes resist changes in fluidity caused by
temperature changes.
t Membraine proteins function in transport, enzymatic activity, attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, cell-cell
recognition, intercellular joining, and signal transduction. Short
chains of sugars linked to proteins (in glycoproteins) and lipids (in
glycolipids) on the exterior side of the plasma membrane interact
with surface molecules of other cells.
t Membrane proteins and lipids are synthesized in the ER and
modified in the ER and Golgi apparatus. The inside and outside
faces of membranes differ in molecular composition.
CONCEPT 5.2
Membrane structure results in selective permeability
(p. 99)
t A cell must exchange substances with its surroundings, a process
controlled by the selective permeability of the plasma membrane. Hydrophobic molecules pass through membranes rapidly,
whereas polar molecules and ions usually need specific transport
proteins.
CONCEPT 5.3
Passive transport is diffusion of a substance across
a membrane with no energy investment
(pp. 99–103)
t Diffusion is the spontaneous movement of a substance down its
concentration gradient. Water diffuses out through the permeable membrane of a cell (osmosis) if the solution outside has a
higher solute concentration than the cytosol (is hypertonic); water
enters the cell if the solution has a lower solute concentration (is
hypotonic). If the
concentrations are
equal (isotonic), no
net osmosis occurs.
Cell survival depends
on balancing water
uptake and loss.

diffusion, a transport protein speeds

t In reception, a signaling molecule binds to a receptor protein,
causing the protein to change shape. Two major types of membrane
receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which work with the help of cytoplasmic G proteins, and ligand-gated ion
channels, which open or close in response to binding by signaling molecules. Signaling molecules that are hydrophobic cross the
plasma membrane and bind to receptors inside the cell.
t At each step in a signal transduction pathway, the signal is transduced into a different form, which commonly involves a change in a
protein’s shape. Many pathways include phosphorylation cascades,
in which a series of protein kinases each add a phosphate group to
the next one in line, activating it. The balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, by protein phosphatases, regulates
the activity of proteins in the pathway.
t Second messengers, such as the small molecule cyclic AMP
(cAMP), diffuse readily through the cytosol and thus help broadcast signals quickly. Many G proteins activate the enzyme that
makes cAMP from ATP.
t The cell’s response to a signal may be the regulation of transcription in the nucleus or of an activity in the cytoplasm.

SUMMARY OF KEY CONCEPTS
CONCEPT 6.1
An organism’s metabolism transforms matter and
energy (pp. 116–119)
t Metabolism is the collection of chemical reactions that occur in an organism. Enzymes catalyze reactions in intersecting
metabolic pathways, which may be catabolic (breaking down
molecules, releasing energy) or anabolic (building molecules,
consuming energy).
t Energy is the capacity to cause change; some forms of energy do
work by moving matter. Kinetic energy is associated with motion and includes thermal energy, associated with the random
motion of atoms or molecules. Heat is thermal energy in transfer
from one object to another. Potential energy is related to the
location or structure of matter and includes chemical energy
possessed by a molecule due to its structure.
t The first law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy, states
that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or
transformed. The second law of thermodynamics states that
spontaneous processes, those requiring no outside input of energy, increase the entropy (disorder) of the universe.
CONCEPT 6.2
The free-energy change of a reaction tells us whether
or not the reaction occurs spontaneously (pp. 119–122)
t A living system’s free energy is energy that can do work under
cellular conditions. Organisms live at the expense of free energy.
The change in free energy (ΔG) during a biological process tells us
if the process is spontaneous. During a spontaneous process, free
energy decreases and the stability of a system increases. At maximum stability, the system is at equilibrium and can do no work.
t In an exergonic (spontaneous) chemical reaction, the products
have less free energy than the reactants (–ΔG). Endergonic (nonspontaneous) reactions require an input of energy (+ΔG). The
addition of starting materials and the removal of end products
prevent metabolism from reaching equilibrium.
CONCEPT 6.3
ATP powers cellular work by coupling exergonic
reactions to endergonic reactions (pp. 122–124)
t ATP is the cell’s energy shuttle. Hydrolysis of its terminal phosphate yields ADP and P i
 and releases free energy.
t Through energy coupling, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis drives endergonic reactions by transfer of a phosphate group
to specific reactants, forming a phosphorylated intermediate
that is more reactive. ATP hydrolysis (sometimes with protein
phosphorylation) also causes changes in the shape and binding
affinities of transport and motor proteins.
t Catabolic pathways drive regeneration of ATP from ADP + P i
.
CONCEPT 6.4
Enzymes speed up metabolic reactions by lowering
energy barriers (pp. 125–130)
t In a chemical reaction, the energy necessary to break the bonds
of the reactants is the activation energy, EA.
t Enzymes lower the EA barrier: Free energy

t Each type of enzyme has a unique active site that combines specifically with its substrate(s), the reactant molecule(s) on which
it acts. The enzyme changes shape slightly when it binds the
substrate(s) (induced fit).
t The active site can lower an EA barrier by orienting substrates
correctly, straining their bonds, providing a favorable microenvironment, or even covalently bonding with the substrate.
t Each enzyme has an optimal temperature and pH. Inhibitors
reduce enzyme function. A competitive inhibitor binds to the
active site, whereas a noncompetitive inhibitor binds to a different site on the enzyme.
t Natural selection, acting on organisms with mutant genes encoding altered enzymes, is a major evolutionary force responsible for
the diverse array of enzymes found in organisms.
CONCEPT 6.5
Regulation of enzyme activity helps control
metabolism (pp. 130–132)
t Many enzymes are subject to allosteric regulation: Regulatory
molecules, either activators or inhibitors, bind to specific regulatory sites, affecting the shape and function of the enzyme. In
cooperativity, binding of one substrate molecule can stimulate
binding or activity at other active sites. In feedback inhibition,
the end product of a metabolic pathway allosterically inhibits the
enzyme for a previous step in the pathway.
t Some enzymes are grouped into complexes, some are incorporated into membranes, and some are contained inside organelles,
increasing the efficiency of metabolic processes.

Catabolic pathways yield energy by oxidizing organic
fuels (pp. 136–140)
t Cells break down glucose and other organic fuels to yield chemical energy in the form of ATP. Fermentation is a partial degradation of glucose without the use of oxygen. Cellular respiration is
a more complete breakdown of glucose; in aerobic respiration,
oxygen is used as a reactant. The cell taps the energy stored in
food molecules through redox reactions, in which one substance
partially or totally shifts electrons to another. Oxidation is the
loss of electrons from one substance, while reduction is the addition of electrons to the other.
t During aerobic respiration, glucose (C6H12O6) is oxidized to CO2,
and O2 is reduced to H2O. Electrons lose potential energy during their transfer from glucose or other organic compounds to
oxygen. Electrons are usually passed first to NAD+
, reducing it to
NADH, and then from NADH to an electron transport chain,
which conducts them to O2 in energy-releasing steps. The energy
is used to make ATP.
t Aerobic respiration occurs in three stages: (1) glycolysis,
(2) pyruvate oxidation and the citric acid cycle, and (3) oxidative
phosphorylation (electron transport and chemiosmosis).
CONCEPT 7.2
Glycolysis harvests chemical energy by oxidizing
glucose to pyruvate (pp. 140–141)

to acetyl CoA, which is further oxidized in the citric acid cycle.

energy-releasing steps. Finally, electrons are passed to O2, reducing it to H2O.

t At certain steps along the
electron transport chain, electron transfer causes protein
complexes to move H+
 from
the mitochondrial matrix (in
eukaryotes) to the intermembrane space, storing energy as
a proton-motive force (H+
gradient). As H+
 diffuses back
into the matrix through ATP
synthase, its passage drives
the phosphorylation of ADP, a
process called chemiosmosis.
t About 34% of the energy
stored in a glucose molecule is
transferred to ATP during cellular respiration, producing a maximum of about 32 ATP.
CONCEPT 7.5
Fermentation and anaerobic respiration enable
cells to produce ATP without the use of oxygen
(pp. 148–151)
t Glycolysis nets 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation,
whether oxygen is present or not. Under anaerobic conditions,
either anaerobic respiration or fermentation can take place. In
anaerobic respiration, an electron transport chain is present
with a final electron acceptor other than oxygen. In fermentation, the electrons from NADH are passed to pyruvate or a derivative of pyruvate, regenerating the NAD+
 required to oxidize
more glucose. Two common types of fermentation are alcohol
fermentation and lactic acid fermentation.
t Fermentation, anaerobic respiration, and aerobic respiration
all use glycolysis to oxidize glucose, but they differ in their final

electron acceptor and whether an electron transport chain is used
(respiration) or not (fermentation). Respiration yields more ATP;
aerobic respiration, with O2 as the final electron acceptor, yields
about 16 times as much ATP as does fermentation.
t Glycolysis occurs in nearly all organisms and is thought to
have evolved in ancient prokaryotes before there was O2 in the
atmosphere.

t Catabolic pathways funnel electrons from many kinds of organic
molecules into cellular respiration. Many carbohydrates can
enter glycolysis, most often after conversion to glucose. Amino
acids of proteins must be deaminated before being oxidized.
The fatty acids of fats undergo beta oxidation to two-carbon
fragments and then enter the citric acid cycle as acetyl CoA.
Anabolic pathways can use small molecules from food directly
or build other substances using intermediates of glycolysis or the
citric acid cycle.

SUMMARY OF KEY CONCEPTS
CONCEPT 8.1
Photosynthesis converts light energy to the chemical
energy of food (pp. 156–159)
t In autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis occurs in
chloroplasts, organelles containing thylakoids. Stacks
of thylakoids form grana. Photosynthesis is summarized as
6 CO2 + 12 H2O + Light energy → C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O.
Chloroplasts split water into hydrogen and oxygen, incorporating the electrons of hydrogen into sugar molecules. Photosynthesis is a redox process: H2O is oxidized, and CO2 is reduced. The
light reactions in the thylakoid membranes split water, releasing
O2, producing ATP, and forming NADPH. The Calvin cycle in
the stroma forms sugars from CO2, using ATP for energy and
NADPH for reducing power.
CONCEPT 8.2
The light reactions convert solar energy to the
chemical energy of ATP and NADPH (pp. 159–167)
t Light is a form of electromagnetic energy. The colors we see as
visible light include those wavelengths that drive photosynthesis.
A pigment absorbs light of specific wavelengths; chlorophyll a is
the main photosynthetic pigment in plants. Other accessory pigments absorb different wavelengths of light and pass the energy on
to chlorophyll a.
t A pigment goes from a ground state to an excited state when a
photon of light boosts one of the pigment’s electrons to a higherenergy electron shell. Electrons from isolated pigments tend to
fall back to the ground state, giving off heat and/or light.
t A photosystem is composed of a reaction-center complex surrounded by light-harvesting complexes that funnel the energy
of photons to the reaction-center complex. When a special pair
of reaction-center chlorophyll a molecules absorbs energy, one of
its electrons is boosted to a higher energy level and transferred to
the primary electron acceptor. Photosystem II contains P680
chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction-center complex;
photosystem I contains P700 molecules.
t Linear electron flow during the light reactions uses both photosystems and produces NADPH, ATP, and oxygen:
t During chemiosmosis in both mitochondria and chloroplasts,
electron transport chains generate an H+
 (proton) gradient across
a membrane. ATP synthase uses this proton-motive force to synthesize ATP.
CONCEPT 8.3
The Calvin cycle uses the chemical energy of ATP
and NADPH to reduce CO2 to sugar (pp. 167–171)
t The Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma, using electrons from
NADPH and energy from ATP. One molecule of G3P exits the
cycle per three CO2 molecules fixed and is converted to glucose
and other organic molecules.

t On hot, dry days, C3 plants close their stomata, conserving
water but keeping CO2 out and O2 in. Under these conditions,
photorespiration can occur: Rubisco binds O2 instead of CO2,
leading to consumption of ATP and release of CO2 without the
production of sugar. Photorespiration may be an evolutionary relic
and it may also play a protective role.
t C4 plants are adapted to hot, dry climates. Even with their stomata partially or completely closed, they minimize the cost of
photorespiration by incorporating CO2 into four-carbon compounds in mesophyll cells. These compounds are exported to
bundle-sheath cells, where they release carbon dioxide for use in
the Calvin cycle.
t CAM plants are also adapted to hot, dry climates. They open
their stomata at night, incorporating CO2 into organic acids,
which are stored in mesophyll cells. During the day, the stomata
close, and the CO2 is released from the organic acids for use in
the Calvin cycle.
t Organic compounds produced by photosynthesis provide the energy and building material for ecosystems.

SUMMARY OF KEY CONCEPTS
t Unicellular organisms reproduce by cell division; multicellular
organisms depend on cell division for their development from a
fertilized egg and for growth and repair. Cell division is part of the
cell cycle, an ordered sequence of events in the life of a cell from
its origin until it divides into daughter cells.
CONCEPT 9.1
Most cell division results in genetically identical
daughter cells (pp. 175–176)
t The genetic material (DNA) of a cell—its genome—is partitioned
among chromosomes. Each eukaryotic chromosome consists of
one DNA molecule associated with many proteins that maintain
chromosome structure and help control the activity of genes.
Together, the complex of DNA and associated proteins is called
chromatin. The chromatin of a chromosome exists in different
states of condensation at different times. In animals, gametes
have one set of chromosomes and somatic cells have two sets.
t Cells replicate their genetic material before they divide, ensuring that each daughter cell can receive a copy of the DNA. In
preparation for cell division, chromosomes are duplicated, each
one then consisting of two identical sister chromatids joined
along their lengths by sister chromatid cohesion and held most
tightly together at a constricted region at the centromeres of the
chromatids. When this cohesion is broken, the chromatids separate during cell division, becoming the chromosomes of the new
daughter cells. Eukaryotic cell division consists of mitosis (division of the nucleus) and cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm).
CONCEPT 9.2
The mitotic phase alternates with interphase
in the cell cycle (pp. 177–183)
t Between divisions, a cell is in interphase: the G1, S, and G2
phases. The cell grows throughout interphase, but DNA is replicated only during the synthesis (S) phase. Mitosis and cytokinesis
make up the mitotic (M) phase of the cell cycle.
t The mitotic spindle is an apparatus of microtubules that controls chromosome movement during mitosis. In animal cells,
the spindle arises from the centrosomes and includes spindle
microtubules and asters. Some spindle microtubules attach
to the kinetochores of chromosomes and move the chromosomes to the metaphase plate. In anaphase, sister chromatids
separate, and motor proteins move them along the kinetochore
microtubules toward opposite ends of the cell. Meanwhile, motor
proteins push nonkinetochore microtubules from opposite poles
away from each other, elongating the cell. In telophase, genetically
identical daughter nuclei form at opposite ends of the cell.
t Mitosis is usually followed by cytokinesis. Animal cells carry out
cytokinesis by cleavage, and plant cells form a cell plate.
t During binary fission in bacteria, the chromosome replicates
and the two daughter chromosomes actively move apart. Some
of the proteins involved in bacterial binary fission are related to
eukaryotic actin and tubulin. Since prokaryotes preceded eukaryotes by more than a billion years, it is likely that mitosis evolved
from prokaryotic cell division.

The eukaryotic cell cycle is regulated by a molecular
control system (pp. 183–189)
t Signaling molecules present in the cytoplasm regulate progress
through the cell cycle.
t The cell cycle control system is molecularly based; key regulatory proteins are kinases and cyclins. The cell cycle clock has
specific checkpoints where the cell cycle stops until a go-ahead
signal is received. Cell culture has enabled researchers to study
the molecular details of cell division. Both internal signals and
external signals control the cell cycle checkpoints via signal transduction pathways. Most cells exhibit density-dependent inhibition of cell division as well as anchorage dependence.
t Cancer cells elude normal cell cycle regulation and divide out of
control, forming tumors. Malignant tumors invade surrounding tissues and can undergo metastasis, exporting cancer cells to
other parts of the body, where they may form secondary tumors.
Recent advances in understanding the cell cycle and cell signaling, as well as techniques for sequencing DNA, have allowed improvements in cancer treatment.

SUMMARY OF KEY CONCEPTS
CONCEPT 10.1
Offspring acquire genes from parents by inheriting
chromosomes (pp. 193–194)
t Each gene in an organism’s DNA exists at a specific locus on a
certain chromosome.
t In asexual reproduction, a single parent produces genetically
identical offspring by mitosis. Sexual reproduction combines
genes from two parents, leading to genetically diverse offspring.
CONCEPT 10.2
Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles
(pp. 194–197)
t Normal human somatic cells are diploid. They have 46 chromosomes made up of two sets of 23 chromosomes, one set from
each parent. Human diploid cells have 22 homologous pairs of
autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes; the latter determines whether the person is female (XX) or male (XY).
t In humans, ovaries and testes produce haploid gametes by
meiosis, each gamete containing a single set of 23 chromosomes
(n = 23). During fertilization, an egg and sperm unite, forming a
diploid (2n = 46) single-celled zygote, which develops into a
multicellular organism by mitosis.

Sexual life cycles differ in the timing of meiosis relative to fertilization and in the point(s) of the cycle at which a multicellular
organism is produced by mitosis.

CONCEPT 10.3
Meiosis reduces the number of chromosome sets
from diploid to haploid (pp. 197–201)
t Meiosis I and meiosis II produce four haploid daughter cells.
The number of chromosome sets is reduced from two (diploid) to
one (haploid) during meiosis I, the reductional division.
t Meiosis is distinguished from mitosis by three events of meiosis I:
Prophase I: Each homologous pair undergoes synapsis
and crossing over between nonsister chromatids with
the subsequent appearance of chiasmata.
Metaphase I: Chromosomes line up as homologous
pairs on the metaphase plate.
Anaphase I: Homologs separate from each other; sister
chromatids remain joined at the centromere.
Meiosis II then separates the sister chromatids.
t Sister chromatid cohesion and crossing over allow chiasmata to
hold homologs together until anaphase I. Cohesins are cleaved
along the arms at anaphase I, allowing homologs to separate, and
at the centromeres in anaphase II, releasing sister chromatids.

CONCEPT 10.4
Genetic variation produced in sexual life cycles
contributes to evolution (pp. 201–204)
t Three events in sexual reproduction contribute to genetic variation in a population: independent assortment of chromosomes
during meiosis, crossing over during meiosis I, and random fertilization of egg cells by sperm. During crossing over, DNA of nonsister chromatids in a homologous pair is broken and rejoined.
t Genetic variation is the raw material for evolution by natural
selection. Mutations are the original source of this variation; recombination of variant genes generates additional diversity

''',

'''
SUMMARY OF KEY CONCEPTS
CONCEPT 11.1
Mendel used the scientific approach to identify two
laws of inheritance (pp. 207–212)
t Gregor Mendel formulated a theory of inheritance based on experiments with garden peas, proposing that parents pass on to
their offspring discrete genes that retain their identity through
generations. This theory includes two “laws.”
t The law of segregation states that
genes have alternative forms, or alleles. In a diploid organism, the two
alleles of a gene segregate (separate)
during meiosis and gamete formation; each sperm or egg carries only
one allele of each pair. This law explains the 3:1 ratio of F2 phenotypes
observed when monohybrids selfpollinate. Each organism inherits one
allele for each gene from each parent.
In heterozygotes, the two alleles are
different, and expression of one (the
dominant allele) masks the phenotypic effect of the other (the recessive allele). Homozygotes have identical alleles of a given gene
and are true-breeding.
t The law of independent assortment states that the pair of
alleles for a given gene segregates into gametes independently
of the pair of alleles for any other gene. In a cross between
dihybrids (individuals heterozygous for two genes), the offspring
have four phenotypes in a 9:3:3:1 ratio.

CONCEPT 11.2
The laws of probability govern Mendelian inheritance
(pp. 213–214)
t The multiplication rule states that the probability of two or
more events occurring together is equal to the product of the
individual probabilities of the independent single events. The
addition rule states that the probability of an event that can
occur in two or more independent, mutually exclusive ways is
the sum of the individual probabilities.
t The rules of probability can be used to solve complex genetics
problems. A dihybrid or other multicharacter cross is equivalent
to two or more independent monohybrid crosses occurring simultaneously. In calculating the chances of the various offspring
genotypes from such crosses, each character is first considered
separately and then the individual probabilities are multiplied.

CONCEPT 11.3
Inheritance patterns are often more complex than
predicted by simple Mendelian genetics (pp. 214–219)

t The expression of a genotype can be affected by environmental
influences. Polygenic characters that are also influenced by the
environment are called multifactorial characters.
t An organism’s overall phenotype reflects its complete genotype
and unique environmental history. Even in more complex inheritance patterns, Mendel’s fundamental laws still apply.

CONCEPT 11.4
Many human traits follow Mendelian patterns
of inheritance (pp. 219–223)
t Analysis of family pedigrees can be used to deduce the possible genotypes of individuals and make predictions about future
offspring. Predictions are statistical probabilities rather than
certainties.

Many genetic disorders are inherited as simple recessive traits,
ranging from relatively mild disorders (albinism, for example) to
life-threatening ones such as sickle-cell disease and cystic fibrosis.
Most affected (homozygous recessive) individuals are children of
phenotypically normal, heterozygous carriers.
t The sickle-cell allele has probably persisted for evolutionary reasons: Heterozygotes have an advantage because one copy of the
sickle-cell allele reduces both the frequency and severity of malaria attacks.
t Lethal dominant alleles are eliminated from the population if affected people die before reproducing. Nonlethal dominant alleles
and lethal alleles that are expressed relatively late in life are inherited in a Mendelian way.
t Many human diseases are multifactorial—that is, they have both
genetic and environmental components and do not follow simple
Mendelian inheritance patterns.
t Using family histories, genetic counselors help couples determine
the probability of their children having genetic disorders

SUMMARY OF KEY CONCEPTS
CONCEPT 12.1
Mendelian inheritance has its physical basis
in the behavior of chromosomes (pp. 228–231)
t The chromosome theory of inheritance states that genes are
located on chromosomes and that the behavior of chromosomes
during meiosis accounts for Mendel’s laws of segregation and independent assortment.
t Morgan’s discovery that transmission of the X chromosome in
Drosophila correlates with inheritance of an eye-color trait was
the first solid evidence indicating that a specific gene is associated
with a specific chromosome.

CONCEPT 12.2
Sex-linked genes exhibit unique patterns
of inheritance (pp. 231–234)
t Sex is often chromosomally based. Humans and other mammals
have an X-Y system in which sex is determined by whether a
Y chromosome is present.
t The sex chromosomes carry sex-linked genes, virtually all of
which are on the X chromosome (X-linked). Any male who inherits a recessive X-linked allele (from his mother) will express
the trait, such as color blindness.
t In mammalian females, one of the two X chromosomes in each cell
is randomly inactivated during early embryonic development, becoming highly condensed into a Barr body.

Linked genes tend to be inherited together because
they are located near each other on the same
chromosome (pp. 234–240)

This F1 cell has 2n = 6 chromosomes and is heterozygous for all

Red = maternal; blue = paternal.
Each chromosome has
hundreds or thousands
of genes. Four (A, B, C,
F) are shown on this one.
The alleles of unlinked
genes are either on
separate chromosomes
(such as d and e)
or so far apart on the
same chromosome
(c and f ) that they
assort independently.
Genes on the same chromosome whose alleles are so
close together that they do
not assort independently
(such as a, b, and c) are said
to be genetically linked.
t An F1 testcross yields parental types with the same combination of
traits as those in the P generation parents and recombinant types
with new combinations of traits. Unlinked genes exhibit a 50%
frequency of recombination in the gametes. For genetically linked
genes, crossing over accounts for the observed recombinants, always less than 50%.
t Recombination frequencies observed in genetic crosses allow
construction of a linkage map (a type of genetic map).

CONCEPT 12.4
Alterations of chromosome number or structure cause
some genetic disorders (pp. 240–243)
t Aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome number, results from
nondisjunction during meiosis. When a normal gamete unites
with one containing two copies or no copies of a particular chromosome, the resulting zygote and its descendant cells either have
one extra copy of that chromosome (trisomy, 2n + 1) or are
missing a copy (monosomy, 2n − 1). Polyploidy (extra sets of
chromosomes) can result from complete nondisjunction.
t Chromosome breakage can result in alterations of chromosome
structure: deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations.

DNA is the genetic material (pp. 245–251)
t Experiments with bacteria and phages provided the first strong
evidence that the genetic material is DNA.
t Watson and Crick deduced that DNA is a double helix and built
a structural model. Two antiparallel sugar-phosphate chains
wind around the outside of the molecule; the nitrogenous bases
project into the interior, where they hydrogen-bond in specific
pairs: A with T, G with C.

Many proteins work together in DNA replication
and repair (pp. 251–259)
t The Meselson-Stahl experiment showed that DNA replication
is semiconservative: The parental molecule unwinds, and each
strand then serves as a template for the synthesis of a new strand
according to base-pairing rules.
t DNA replication at one replication fork is summarized here:

DNA polymerases proofread new DNA, replacing incorrect
nucleotides. In mismatch repair, enzymes correct errors that
persist. Nucleotide excision repair is a general process by which
nucleases cut out and replace damaged stretches of DNA.

A chromosome consists of a DNA molecule packed
together with proteins (pp. 259–261)
t The chromosome of most bacterial species is a circular DNA
molecule with some associated proteins, making up the nucleoid of the cell. The chromatin making up a eukaryotic chromosome
is composed of DNA, histones, and other proteins. The histones
bind to each other and to the DNA to form nucleosomes, the
most basic units of DNA packing. Additional coiling and folding
lead ultimately to the highly condensed chromatin of the metaphase chromosome. In interphase cells, most chromatin is less
compacted (euchromatin), but some remains highly condensed
(heterochromatin). Euchromatin, but not heterochromatin, is
generally accessible for transcription of genes.

Understanding DNA structure and replication makes
genetic engineering possible (pp. 261–265)
t Gene cloning (or DNA cloning) produces multiple copies of a
gene (or DNA fragment) that can be used to manipulate and analyze DNA and to produce useful new products or organisms with
beneficial traits.
t In genetic engineering, bacterial restriction enzymes are
used to cut DNA molecules within short, specific nucleotide
sequences (restriction sites), yielding a set of double-stranded
restriction fragments with single-stranded sticky ends.

DNA fragments of different lengths can be separated and their
lengths assessed by gel electrophoresis.
t The sticky ends on restriction fragments from one DNA source—
such as a bacterial plasmid or other cloning vector—can basepair with complementary sticky ends on fragments from other
DNA molecules; sealing the base-paired fragments with DNA
ligase produces recombinant DNA molecules.
t The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can produce many copies
of (amplify) a specific target segment of DNA in vitro for use as a
DNA fragment for cloning. PCR uses primers that bracket the desired segment and requires a heat-resistant DNA polymerase.
t The rapid development of fast, inexpensive techniques for
DNA sequencing is based on sequencing by synthesis: DNA
polymerase is used to replicate a stretch of DNA from a singlestranded template, and the order in which nucleotides are added
reveals the sequence.

SUMMARY OF KEY CONCEPTS
CONCEPT 14.1
Genes specify proteins via transcription
and translation (pp. 269–274)
t DNA controls metabolism by directing cells to make specific
enzymes and other proteins, via the process of gene expression.
Beadle and Tatum’s studies of mutant strains of Neurospora led to
the one gene–one polypeptide hypothesis. Genes code for polypeptide chains or specify RNA molecules.
t Transcription is the synthesis of RNA complementary to a
template strand of DNA, providing a nucleotide-to-nucleotide
transfer of information. Translation is the synthesis of a polypeptide whose amino acid sequence is specified by the nucleotide
sequence in mRNA; this informational transfer involves a change
of language, from that of nucleotides to that of amino acids.
t Genetic information is encoded as a sequence of nonoverlapping nucleotide triplets, or codons. A codon in messenger RNA
(mRNA) either is translated into an amino acid (61 of the 64 codons) or serves as a stop signal (3 codons). Codons must be read
in the correct reading frame.

CONCEPT 14.2
Transcription is the DNA-directed synthesis of RNA:
a closer look (pp. 274–276)
t RNA synthesis is catalyzed by RNA polymerase, which links
together RNA nucleotides complementary to a DNA template
strand. This process follows the same base-pairing rules as DNA
replication, except that in RNA, uracil substitutes for thymine.
The three stages of transcription are initiation, elongation, and termination. A promoter, often including a TATA box in eukaryotes,
establishes where RNA synthesis is initiated. Transcription factors
help eukaryotic RNA polymerase recognize promoter sequences,
forming a transcription initiation complex. The mechanisms of
termination are different in bacteria and eukaryotes.

CONCEPT 14.3
Eukaryotic cells modify RNA
after transcription
(pp. 276–278)
t Eukaryotic pre-mRNAs undergo
RNA processing, which includes
RNA splicing, the addition of a modified nucleotide 5′ cap to the 5′ end, and the addition of a
poly-A tail to the 3′ end.
t Most eukaryotic genes are split into segments: They have introns
interspersed among the exons (regions included in the mRNA). In
RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons joined. RNA splicing
is typically carried out by spliceosomes, but in some cases, RNA
alone catalyzes its own splicing. The catalytic ability of some RNA
molecules, called ribozymes, derives from the properties of RNA.
The presence of introns allows for alternative RNA splicing.

CONCEPT 14.4
Translation is the RNA-directed synthesis
of a polypeptide: a closer look (pp. 278–288)
t A cell translates an mRNA message into protein using transfer
RNAs (tRNAs). After being bound to a specific amino acid by an
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, a tRNA lines up via its anticodon
at the complementary codon on mRNA. A ribosome, made up
of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and proteins, facilitates this coupling with binding sites for mRNA and tRNA.
t Ribosomes coordinate the three stages of translation: initiation,
elongation, and termination. The formation of peptide bonds between amino acids is catalyzed by rRNA as tRNAs move through
the A and P sites and exit through the E site.
t After translation, modifications
to proteins can affect their shape.
Free ribosomes in the cytosol initiate synthesis of all proteins, but
proteins with a signal peptide
are synthesized on the ER.
t A gene can be transcribed by
multiple RNA polymerases
simultaneously. A single mRNA
molecule can be translated simultaneously by a number of ribosomes, forming a polyribosome.
In bacteria, these processes are
coupled, but in eukaryotes they
are separated in time and space by the nuclear membrane.

CONCEPT 14.5
Mutations of one or a few nucleotides can affect
protein structure and function (pp. 288–290)
t Small-scale mutations include point mutations, changes in one
DNA nucleotide pair, which may lead to production of nonfunctional proteins. Nucleotide-pair substitutions can cause
missense or nonsense mutations. Nucleotide-pair insertions
or deletions may produce frameshift mutations.
t Spontaneous mutations can occur during DNA replication, recombination, or repair. Chemical and physical mutagens cause
DNA damage that can alter genes.

Summary of Key Conept
CONCEPT 15.1
Bacteria often respond to environmental change
by regulating transcription (pp. 293–298)
•	 In bacteria, certain groups of genes are clustered into an operon
with a single promoter. An operator site on the DNA switches the
operon on or off, resulting in coordinate regulation of the genes.
•	 Both repressible and inducible operons are examples of negative
gene regulation. Binding of a specific repressor protein to the
operator shuts off transcription. (The repressor is encoded by a
separate regulatory gene.) In a repressible operon, the repressor is
active when bound to a corepressor.
In an inducible operon, binding of an inducer to an innately
active repressor inactivates the repressor and turns on transcription. Inducible enzymes usually function in catabolic pathways.
•	 Some operons have positive gene regulation. A stimulatory activator protein (such as CAP, when activated by cyclic AMP),
binds to a site within the promoter and stimulates transcription.

ukaryotic gene expression is regulated at many
stages (pp. 298–305)
Chromatin modification
• Genes in highly compacted
chromatin are generally not
transcribed.
Transcription
• Regulation of transcription initiation:
DNA control elements in enhancers
bind specific transcription factors.
• The genes in a coordinately controlled
group all share a combination of control
elements.
• Alternative RNA splicing:
• Initiation of translation can be controlled via
regulation of initiation factors.
Bending of
the DNA
enables
activators to
contact proteins at
the promoter, initiating transcription.
• Histone acetylation seems
to loosen chromatin
structure,
enhancing
transcription.
• DNA methylation generally
reduces transcription.
Chromatin modification

and degradation
Primary RNA

• Each mRNA has a
characteristic life span.
mRNA degradation
Translation
• Protein processing and degradation are
subject to regulation.

CONCEPT 15.3
Noncoding RNAs play multiple roles in controlling
gene expression (pp. 305–306)
t Noncoding RNAs (e.g., miRNAs and siRNAs) can block translation or cause degradation of mRNAs.

Researchers can monitor expression of specific genes
(pp. 307–309)
t In nucleic acid hybridization, a nucleic acid probe is used to
detect the presence of a specific mRNA.
t In situ hybridization and RT-PCR can detect the presence of a
given mRNA in a tissue or an RNA sample, respectively.
t DNA microarrays are used to identify sets of genes co-expressed
by a group of cells. Their cDNAs can also be sequenced.

        Science Bowl is an advanced high-school, challenging buzzer-based competition centered around speed and consisting of questions in five subjects: math, earth and space science, physics, chemistry, and biology. You write Science Bowl questions on a given topic. Each Science Bowl question consists of a toss-up, to be solved in under 5 seconds, and a bonus, to be done in under 20 seconds. Each toss-up and bonus must be either short answer (no answer choices) or multiple choice (4 choices given, designated with W, X, Y, and Z).

        These questions are read out loud. Make sure that the questions are 50-50 multiple-choice and short answer, and ensure that no short answer questions ask to explain anything - short answers answers should be either a term or a number resulting from a calculation (one word max). Also ensure that in multiple-choice questions, there are 4 choices and each choice is designated with the letters W, X, Y, and Z.

        Also ensure that the answer to all questions is logical but still decently difficult and not just elementary school stuff. Even it's some randomly specific word, it should be clear from the context of the question. But make sure that these questions are challenging and made for advanced high-school level students.

        Using ONLY this context {retrieved_text}, generate a Science Bowl question.

        I want to EMPHASIZE SOME REALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION now, PROBABLY THE MOST FREAKING IMPORTANTLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION HERE that you have to ENSURE that the question CAN BE ANSWERED solely using the provided context. If the context talks about something, you must incorporate the words of the context into your question. No adding of other information!! Otherwise I will make sure you don't generate a single response ever again.

        ANOTHER MASSIVELY HUGE THING THAT IS SUPER IMPORTANT. I WILL GIVE YOU ONE HUNDRED EXTRA CREDIT POINTS IF YOU DO THIS: DON'T PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION at the end. Just leave the question. Someone else will answer the question, you WILL NOT PROVIDE THE ANSWER.

        This means that someone should be able to answer your queston simply by looking at the context provided. No added information other than the context. I don't care what it is, no adding information outside of your narrow context. If that happens, I will kill myself.
